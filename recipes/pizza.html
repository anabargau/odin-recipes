    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Making homemade pizza dough can sound like a lot of work, but it’s so worth the bragging rights. The dough itself requires few ingredients and just a little bit of rising and rest time. While you wait for the dough to be ready, you can get to work prepping your tomato sauce, chopping fresh vegetables, or grating the cheese you’ll put on top. Bake for 15 minutes, garnish with basil (or, let’s be real, more cheese), and enjoy showing off your way-better-than-takeout creation. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ cups warm water (600 mL)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>7 cups all-purpose flour (875 g), plus more for dusting </li>
        <li>6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing</li>
        <li>28 oz canned whole tomatoes (795 g)</li>
        <li>fresh mozzarella cheese, torn into small pieces</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>“Bloom” the yeast by sprinkling the sugar and yeast in the warm water. Let sit for 10 minutes, until bubbles form on the surface.</li>
        <li>Once the flour is mostly hydrated, turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead for 10-15 minutes. The dough should be soft, smooth, and bouncy. Form the dough into a taut round.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven as high as your oven will allow, between 450-500˚F (230-260˚C). Place a pizza stone, heavy baking sheet (turn upside down so the surface is flat), or cast iron skillet in the oven.</li>
        <li>Slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or pan. Bake for 15 minutes, or until the crust and cheese are golden brown.</li>
        
    </ol>
